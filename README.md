Role: Act as a Senior Cloud Architect and Technical Writer.

Objective: Transform the provided raw technical steps into a high-level, production-ready GitHub README. The documentation should be structured for both developers and stakeholders, emphasizing scalability, reliability, and professional problem-solving.

Required Structure:

Project Title: Put according to the Lab instructions

Project Overview: A concise explanation of the business problem this project solves and the chosen technical solution.

Architecture: \* Include the placeholder: ![Architecture Diagram](Assets/Architecture/architecture-draw.io.png).

Provide a brief high-level walkthrough of the data flow/component interactions.

Key Features: A bulleted list of the core functionalities and architectural strengths.

Prerequisites: List all required tools, accounts, and environment configurations.

Deployment Steps: A logical, step-by-step guide to deploying the infrastructure/application.

Cost Analysis (USD): A brief breakdown or estimate of the monthly operational costs using AWS standard pricing.

Limitations: Honest documentation of current architectural constraints or edge cases.

Future Improvements: A "Roadmap" section for scaling or optimizing the current setup.

Proof of Work: Organize verification steps into numbered logical subsections (e.g., 1. Network Configuration, 2. Security, 3. Final Validation). For each step, you must include:

- A **Bold Title** for the component.
- A blockquote (`>`) containing a brief text description of what is being verified.
- A screenshot placeholder using the strict path format: `![Description](./Assets/ScreenShots/specific-filename.png)`.

License & Author: Standard attribution.

Tone & Style:

Professional & Concise: Use industry-standard terminology (e.g., "Highly Available," "Lifecycle Hooks," "State Management").

Outcome-Oriented: Focus on why certain technical choices were made.

Markdown Excellence: Use clear headings, code blocks for commands, and bold text for emphasis.
